# YouTube Downloader - Android App Setup

Your YouTube downloader website has been successfully converted into an Android app using Capacitor! 

## What Was Done

âœ… **Capacitor Integration**: Added Capacitor framework to wrap your React web app
âœ… **Mobile-Specific Code**: Added Android file download handling using device storage
âœ… **Build Configuration**: Created mobile-specific build scripts and configurations
âœ… **Android Permissions**: Added necessary permissions for internet and file storage
âœ… **Network Security**: Configured network security for API communication

## How It Works

The Android app runs your existing React frontend but with enhanced mobile capabilities:

- **Smart Downloads**: Automatically detects if running on mobile vs web
- **Native File Storage**: Downloads videos directly to the device's Documents folder
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with mobile-optimized UI
- **Native Feel**: Looks and behaves like a native Android app

## Building and Running

### 1. Build the Mobile App
```bash
node build-mobile.js
```

### 2. Open in Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```

### 3. Run on Device/Emulator
- In Android Studio, click the "Run" button
- Select your connected Android device or emulator
- The app will install and launch automatically

## Development Workflow

### For Web Changes:
1. Make changes to your React code in `client/src/`
2. Test with `npm run dev` as usual
3. When ready for mobile, run `node build-mobile.js`
4. Sync with `npx cap sync`

### For Mobile-Specific Changes:
1. Modify Capacitor configuration in `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Update Android permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
3. Rebuild with `node build-mobile.js`

## Key Files Added/Modified

- `capacitor.config.ts` - Capacitor configuration
- `vite.config.mobile.ts` - Mobile build configuration  
- `build-mobile.js` - Mobile build script
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - API handling for mobile
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Mobile download functionality
- `android/` - Native Android project files

## API Configuration

The mobile app can connect to:
- **Development**: Local server (localhost:5000)
- **Production**: Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable

For production deployment, you'll need to:
1. Deploy your backend server to a public URL
2. Set the API URL in your build environment
3. Rebuild the mobile app

## Next Steps

1. **Test the App**: Install on a real Android device to test downloads
2. **Customize Icon**: Replace the default icon in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap/`
3. **App Store**: Prepare for Google Play Store publishing
4. **Backend Deployment**: Deploy your server for production use

## Troubleshooting

- **Downloads Not Working**: Check internet permissions and network security config
- **Build Errors**: Ensure Android Studio and SDK are properly installed
- **API Connection**: Verify the backend server is running and accessible

Your website is now a fully functional Android app! ðŸš€
